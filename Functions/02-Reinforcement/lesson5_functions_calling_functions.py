"""
   Here's something really cool: our functions can work together as a team!
   Just like how you might ask a friend to help you with something, one function 
   can "call" (ask for help from) another function.

   Think of it like this:
   - You have a function that knows how to add numbers
   - You have another function that knows how to multiply numbers  
   - You can create a NEW function that uses BOTH of them to solve bigger problems!

   Let's create a simple calculator where functions work together!
